The radial velocity (RV) technique is responsible for the first convincing exoplanet discovered
around a Sun-like star (Mayor & Queloz 1995) with a mass similar to Jupiter. Since this
discovery, exoplanet detection has exploded as a field, motivated by the search for Earth-like
planets outside the Solar System. In recent years, instruments such as HARPS (Mayor et al.
2003) and ESPRESSO (Pepe et al. 2021) have demonstrated the ability to detect planets with
a similar mass to Earth. Demangeon et al. (2021) announced the detection of the lowest-mass
planet measured so far using RVs: L 98-59 b, a rocky planet with half the mass of Venus. If
confirmed, this planet would sit in the middle of the habitable zone of the L 98-59 system.
These results represent an important achievement in the quest for life outside the Solar
System; as such, this paper re-examines the RV detection of L 98-59 b.
